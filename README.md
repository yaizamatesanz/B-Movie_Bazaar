# üõí B-Movie Bazaar  
**Final Evaluation of Module 1** | Data Analytics Bootcamp  

## Description  
Welcome to my first project from the bootcamp, where I created a simulation of an online store with a unique twist: it‚Äôs a store for B-movie films! This exercise combines object-oriented programming with ecommerce concepts, managing inventory and sales efficiently.

### üé• Main Features  
- **Add products**: Add new items to the inventory or update existing quantities.  
- **View inventory**: Display all available products.  
- **Search products**: Find products by name or pattern using regular expressions (regex).  
- **Update stock**: Modify product quantities in the inventory.  
- **Remove products**: Delete items from the inventory.  
- **Calculate inventory value**: Determine the total value of all available products.  
- **Make purchases**: Simulate the purchase process by selecting products from the inventory.  
- **Process payments**: Calculate the change after processing a purchase.  
- **Customer management**: Register new customers and their purchase history.  
- **Analyze sales**: Calculate the total sales of the ecommerce store.

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Personal Note  
This project is not only a reflection of my technical skills but also of my creativity. By choosing a theme like B-movies, I wanted to show that learning can be fun and meaningful.  

Thank you for taking the time to review my work! I hope you enjoy it as much as I did while developing it. üí°
